Very Unsupported GCC 9.2.0 Compiler for VCS 2022.06
Very Very Unsupported GCC 7.3.0 Compiler for VCS 2020.03, VCS 2021.09, VCS 2022.06
Very Very Very Unsupported GCC 6.2.0 Compiler for VCS 2018.09
tested with SystemC on RHEL8

**DISCLAIMER: Things won't just out of the box, RHEL comes with gcc 8.5.0 if you have
it installed older versions of gcc may just work but if you trying to use gcc 9+ consider
installing dev toolset gcc 9 so it will use gcc 9.2.1 libraries for less work, if
you explicitly describe the ld libraries and includes without any compiler in path it would
be even better**
**Rest of checking compilers for environment should be available in RHEL DOCS and Support**
**Version Numbers are just the tested ones by me as of moment, rest support yu gotta test 
yurself**

This directory contains the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).

The GNU Compiler Collection is free software.  See the files whose
names start with COPYING for copying permission.  The manuals, and
some of the runtime libraries, are under different terms; see the
individual source files for details.

The directory INSTALL contains copies of the installation information
as HTML and plain text.  The source of this information is
gcc/doc/install.texi.  The installation information includes details
of what is included in the GCC sources and what files GCC installs.

See the file gcc/doc/gcc.texi (together with other files that it
includes) for usage and porting information.  An online readable
version of the manual is in the files gcc/doc/gcc.info*.

See http://gcc.gnu.org/bugs/ for how to report bugs usefully.

Copyright years on GCC source files may be listed using range
notation, e.g., 1987-2012, indicating that every year in the range,
inclusive, is a copyrightable year that could otherwise be listed
individually.
